                    We founded Pocket PhDs with one mission: to connect students
                    with the brightest minds we know to maximize their
                    educational experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With years of experience in the academic world as students
                    and teachers, we have seen the benefits of 1-on-1, in-person
                    learning to maximize student outcomes and educational
                    experiences. However, multiple challenges exist for students
                    in the current learning landscape. Time spent traveling,
                    fitting sessions into busy schedules outside of normal
                    homework hours, and the inability to provide help outside of
                    appointments are some of the many obstacles students face.
                    To overcome these challenges, we utilize mobile technology
                    to connect with our students any time they need help, no
                    scheduling required!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We are PhD candidates studying Neuroscience at Washington
                    University in St. Louis. On campus, we are fortunate each
                    day to be around the brightest minds in the world in the
                    fields of math, science, and engineering. As PhD students
                    and degree holders, these talented individuals have been
                    trained in best teaching practices, as teaching
                    assistantships are required in all PhD graduate programs.
                    Not only are these people insanely smart, but they have also
                    been trained to communicate difficult concepts in the
                    classroom. We want all students to be connected with this
                    amazing network of academics. With high quality tutors
                    available at the click of a button, we believe Pocket PhDs
                    services will get students exactly what they need: quick
                    access to experts who are masters in the subjects of their
                    schoolwork.
                  </p>
                  <p>Happy Learning!</p>
